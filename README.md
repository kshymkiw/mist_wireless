# mist_wireless
This is a python script which pulls Org Level Stats from the Mist REST API, and puts them into InfluxDB.

### Configuration

You will need the following from your Mist Account
1. Org ID - This is accessible from https://manage.mist.com Then click on Organization and Settings.  You can copy your Org ID directly from here.
2. Your API Token - If you haven't created one, make sure you're logged into your Mist Dashboard, and go to https://api.mist.com/api/v1/self/apitokens and hit POST

Drop these 2 pieces of information into the Python script where it is called for.

### How to use the script

Will update
